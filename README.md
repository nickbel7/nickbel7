# hey, i'm Nikos 👋

research engineer @ [MIT Media Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu/) doing BCI things • co-founder @ [CALT](https://github.com/nickbel7) making culture less boring • ex-[arrikto](https://github.com/arrikto) where i learned kubernetes is just yaml all the way down

MEng from NTUA where i spent 5 years convincing professors that "works on my laptop" counts as distributed systems

## currently

- 🧠 migrating NeuroChat from firebase to something that scales (narrator: *it's complicated*)
- 🎭 building a cultural events recommender that actually understands you're not into jazz (yet)
- ⚡ making IoT systems process energy data in real-time because someone has to save the planet
- 🎓 supervising undergrads on their thesis, which is 70% debugging, 30% existential crisis

## in a parallel universe i'm

📸 a professional photographer • 🏃 actually consistent at running • 🎙️ hosting a podcast called "that's nuts" • 🏄 surfing instead of debugging • 🎬 running open-air cinema screenings

## tech i use without crying

python • flutter • kubernetes • figma • postgres • the entire alphabet soup of modern web dev

*(most of my public github repos are old student projects, don't judge me)*
